# Blockchain for Secure Data Sharing – Final Year Project

## Overview
A prototype blockchain system enabling secure, encrypted data sharing between trusted organizations (e.g., Hospital, Lab, Insurance) using:
- **Proof-of-Authority (PoA)** consensus
- **AES-256-GCM** encryption
- **Tamper-evident** blockchain structure

## Features
- Only authorized organizations can add blocks
- Data is encrypted per-organization
- Chain integrity validation detects tampering
- Simulated multi-org access control

## How to Run
1. `npm install` (no dependencies needed)
2. `node index.js`

## Academic Use
Designed as a final-year undergraduate project demonstrating core blockchain concepts for secure inter-organizational data exchange.
